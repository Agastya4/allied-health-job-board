## Troubleshooting

### **No suggestions appearing:**
- Ensure address query is at least 3 characters
- Check that it's an Australian address
- Wait 1-2 seconds for API response (free API is slower)

### **Address validation fails:**
- Try a more specific address
- Use standard Australian address format
- Check browser console for any errors
